Hello World! My name is Shane Hesprich and as of 5/16/2022 I am the Research Engineer for High Performance Computing at Marquette University. I am currently taking a course on Data Science as part of my continueing education. Part of this course requires us to learn to use GitHub. I am excited for this as I feel I have always wanted to learn git, but have never had the time to dedicate to doing it properly.
